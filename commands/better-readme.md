# Better README Command

This command analyzes your project structure and either creates a new README.md or optimizes an existing one based on the project type and structure.

## Usage

    /better-readme

## What this command does:

1. **Project Analysis**: 
   - Determines project type (framework, library, end-user product, etc.)
   - Identifies if it's a monorepo or single project
   - Detects target audience (developers, enterprise, consumers)

2. **README Creation/Optimization**:
   - Creates a new README.md if none exists
   - Improves existing README based on best practices
   - Ensures professional, concise, and highly readable content

3. **Content Principles**:
   - **Professional**: Industry-standard formatting and structure
   - **Concise**: High readability with clear, scannable sections
   - **User-focused**: Immediately communicates project purpose and usage

## Process

Now I will analyze this project and create or improve the README:

### Step 1: Check for existing README

First, let me check if a README.md already exists in the project root.

### Step 2: Analyze project structure

I'll examine the project to understand:
- Project type and purpose
- Technology stack
- Key features and functionality
- Target audience

### Step 3: Generate README content

Based on my analysis, I'll create a professional README with:
- Clear project title and description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Features list
- Contributing guidelines (if applicable)
- License information

### Step 4: Write the README

I'll now write the README.md file with the optimized content.
