# Changelog for git-commit-with-changelog

## v2.3.0 - 2025-11-26
### Changed
- **Commit first**: Workflow now commits code BEFORE asking about CHANGELOG
- **Phase order reversed**: Phase 1 is now "Commit First", Phase 2 is "CHANGELOG Management"
- **CHANGELOG is optional**: Default behavior skips CHANGELOG, ask user after commit completes
- **Cleaner separation**: Code commits and CHANGELOG commits are always separate

### Updated
- All scenarios and examples reflect the new "commit first" workflow
- Command behavior section emphasizes "COMMIT FIRST" principle
- Version workflow simplified with new flow diagram

## v2.2.0 - 2025-11-23
### Changed
- **CHANGELOG philosophy**: Now focused on end users, not developers
- **Manual curation**: Ask user for concise summaries instead of auto-generating from commits
- **Simplified format**: Plain bullet points instead of Added/Fixed/Changed subsections
- **Most commits skip CHANGELOG**: Only update during release preparation

### Added
- CHANGELOG philosophy section with good/bad examples
- User-focused language guidelines (2-5 lines per version)
- Development workflow example (days of commits → single release summary)

### Fixed
- CHANGELOG no longer technical/verbose commit duplication
- Version summaries now meaningful to software users

## v2.1.0 - 2025-11-23
### Changed
- **CHANGELOG now reflects real version history**: Only git-tagged versions appear as versioned sections
- **[Unreleased] section**: New commits added to [Unreleased] until version is tagged
- **Tag-based validation**: Repair CHANGELOG based on git tags, not every commit
- **Version detection priority**: git tags > project files > default
- **Version sync on tag only**: Only update version files when git tag exists

### Added
- Version workflow documentation: development → [Unreleased] → tag → versioned section
- Tag-to-tag commit parsing with `git log <prev-tag>..<tag>`
- Auto-move [Unreleased] entries to versioned section when tag detected

### Fixed
- CHANGELOG no longer bloated with every single commit
- Version history accurately reflects released versions only

## v2.0.0 - 2025-11-23
### Breaking Changes
- Renamed command from `/git-commit` to `/git-commit-with-changelog`

### Added
- **CHANGELOG validation**: Always verify CHANGELOG matches git history before any operation
- **Auto-repair**: Automatically fix missing or incorrect CHANGELOG entries from git history
- Two-phase workflow: Phase 1 (validation/repair) always runs, Phase 2 (new commit) only if changes exist
- Separate commit for CHANGELOG repairs when needed
- Git history parsing to reconstruct missing CHANGELOG entries retroactively

### Changed
- Command description updated to reflect validation/repair focus
- Workflow restructured into Phase 1 (validation) and Phase 2 (commit)
- Enhanced important notes with validation-first approach
- Updated all examples to use new command name
