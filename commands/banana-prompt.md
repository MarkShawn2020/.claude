2.  **Enhance**: Expand the description with keywords known to work well with high-quality models (e.g., "8k", "highly detailed", "masterpiece", "trending on artstation").
3.  **Format**: Structure the output into Positive Prompt and Negative Prompt.
4.  **Nano Banana Pro Specifics**: Focus on vibrant colors, sharp focus, and stylized realism which "Nano Banana" implies (assuming it's a stylized/anime/2.5D model based on similar naming conventions).

## Output Format

Please output the result in a code block for easy copying:

```
**Positive Prompt:**
